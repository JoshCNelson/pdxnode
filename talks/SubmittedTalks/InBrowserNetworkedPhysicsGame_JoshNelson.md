## Building an In-Browser Networked Physics Game

To paraphrase a James Bond movie, "Swagger is not enough". 

You've done the work to set up OpenAPI specification REST calls for your APIs (Inaccurately known as Swagger). You have reference information. But you discover that few users are actually trying REST calls on your system. You're wondering: "What else do I need?"

This presentation will describe the Minimal Viable Documentation (MVD) for RESTful APIs, also known as "What do I need for my developer portal?"

Based loosely on Kristof Van Tomme's presentations on Developer Experience, Mike will describe the MVD for a developer portal, what will help your developers try out your APIs.

Josh will present the following core topics: 

* `Games in the browser` - The building blocks for a local, in-browser game
* `Network architecture` - Connecting players over the internet
* `State synchronization` - Creating an authoritative game state timeline
* `Optimizations` - Latency estimation, reducing bandwidth, etc..
