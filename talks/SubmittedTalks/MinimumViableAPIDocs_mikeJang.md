## Minimum Viable Documentation for RESTful APIs

To paraphrase a James Bond movie, "Swagger is not enough". 

You've done the work to set up OpenAPI specification REST calls for your APIs (Inaccurately known as Swagger). You have reference information. But you discover that few users are actually trying REST calls on your system. You're wondering: "What else do I need?"

This presentation will describe the Minimal Viable Documentation (MVD) for RESTful APIs, also known as "What do I need for my developer portal?"

Based loosely on Kristof Van Tomme's presentations on Developer Experience, Mike will describe the MVD for a developer portal, what will help your developers try out your APIs.

Mike will present viable examples of: 

* `Landing Pages` that describe the API
* `Tutorials` that help the user get started
* `Blogs` that show active development
* `Reference` information satisfied by the OpenAPI specification

This is a preview of a talk that Mike will give at the API Strategy Conference in Nashville on September 26, ref https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/program/schedule/

As a senior technical writer for ForgeRock, Mike spends much of his time documenting how deployers can modify JavaScript to customize web applications. He still has to help maintain over 200 curl commands in product documentation.

He has also written a couple dozen technical books, mostly focused on Linux certification, and is the author of O’Reilly’s Linux Annoyances for Geeks.

He's a bit embarrased by his Git Hub account, https://github.com/mjang
