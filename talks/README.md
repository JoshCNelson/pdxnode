## Talk Submission FAQ

**Want to speak at an upcoming PDXNode event?**
  - Follow the guides on submitting a [Lightning talk](./lightning.md) or [Longform talk](./longform.md). Reach out to an organizer if you need help, have questions, or want some feedback before submitting. 

**I want to give a shorter/longer talk than the time listed for the next meetup. Can I give a talk with a different time?**
  - Submit something anyways and reach out! We can probably make it work.

**Am I qualified enough to give a talk?**
  - **YES!!** We LOVE first time speakers! Come show off your projects or talk to us about your learning experience. Everyone has something to teach. Start off with a short form [Lightning talk](./lightning.md) and be cheered on by supportive organizers and meetup attendees. 

**Have More Questions? Want to chat?**
  - Connect with an organizer via Twitter DM [@PDXNode](https://twitter.com/pdxnode) or come chat with us on [#pdxnode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=pdxnode&uio=d4) on freenode or via our [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/pdxnode/Lobby).
